Hello All,

This is Steve Aigbe, a first year Phd student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston Texas.
I am a national of Nigeria, the most populous black nation in the world. I am married to a lovely wife, Isoken Aigbe, who is currently working in Lagos, Nigeria. She will be joining me in Houston by November this year.
